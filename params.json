A piece of paper printed with ar tags will be treated as the imaginary bad guy and the goal of the turtlebot is to pierce through the tag with a sharp spear when the master places the order. As in real battlefield, soldiers communicate with each other via professional gestures instead of giving vocal commands, a safe and easy approach to operate the turtlebot is to use gesture control via an armband named MYO.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou need a MYO armband and a Turtlebot to play with this project.
