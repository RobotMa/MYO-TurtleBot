# 1:Gesture Controlled \& Autonomous Turtlebot

In this project, the Turtlebot is transformed into a robot bodyguard which can attack the dangerous target given human's command. A piece of paper printed with ar tags will be treated as the imaginary bad guy and the goal of the turtlebot is to pierce through the tag with a sharp spear when the master places the order. As in real battlefield, soldiers communicate with each other via professional gestures instead of giving vocal commands, a safe and easy approach to operate the turtlebot is to use gesture control via an armband named MYO.

## Installation

You need a MYO armband and a Turtlebot with Kinect to play with the code.
